# ML From Scratch

Implementations of core machine learning algorithms from scratch.

## Models
- Linear Regression (Gradient Descent)
- Logistic Regression (Binary Classification)

## Goal
Rebuild first-principles understanding of:
- loss functions
- gradients
- optimization

## Next Steps
- Add loss curve plots
- Extend to multivariate features
